        <h2>Day 1: introduction</h2>    
        <p>During the first day of the BSD course we created a website and went over the basics of HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). We then after going over the basics of JavaScript began to create a bar chart from a google sheet using JavaScript, I found this quite challenging and fun. I learned a lot of new JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>Day 2: creating pie charts</h2>    
        <p>During the second day of the coding course, we finished off our bar charts and learned how to create pie charts. I found creating pie charts easier to learn as I already had experence in creating bar charts from earlier, and a lot of the code was similar. We then learned how we could embed our chart site into our progress blogs using the 'iframe' tag in HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language). While we were finializing our Blog sites we added lists using the 'ul' tags to show our sources for our information.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>    
        <p>Over the past couple days I have learned <em>lots</em> about coding in HTML CSS and JavaScript. For example how to create web pages with pleasant designs or visualise data using pie charts or bar charts. Overall I throughly enjoyed the course.</p>

      <h2>Pie Chart:</h2>
      <p>Bellow you can see a Pie chart and Table that was created from data extracted from a google sheet. Which shows how many fast food ad's are seen by children during 2012. </p>

      <h2>What Do These Results Show?</h2>
      <p>The results shown in this pie chart clearly show that a large number of fast food advertisements are seen by children (aged 6-11) This could be the reason why obesity is on the rise over the last decade, the rate of obesity in US adults has risen to one third of the population (36.5%), I think this is due to many children being shown fast food advertisments. I found that the reason why McDonalds advertisments are so far in the lead is beacuse McDonalds has the highest advertisment budget in the world. In 2012 mcdonalds spent 963 million US dollars on adverts, this means that for every 6 US dollars spent on advertisments one of them was from McDonalds. Another reason why McDonalds is on the top of fast food advertisements may be as they place their ad's in strategic places, like on highways, subways, on the television, and even at sporting events, all these places are strategic as they are in places where lots of people will see them. In conclusion, the reason why McDonalds is so far ahead of any other fast food advertisment is due to a high budget and strategic placement of adverts.</p>
